Hidden Tumblr
===========

Hidden Tumblr is a Google Chrome extension that hides a post, all of it's futer and past reblogs. Useful for when you are tired of seeing a specific post show up on your dashboard over and over again.

Installation
-----------

The correct way to install this is from the Chrome Web Store. I'm currently testing the extension with a few people before publishing to the store. You can do one of the following:

- If you would like to join in the testing, ask me on [Tumblr](http://defvayne23.tumblr.com/ask).
- If you would like to install this extension, first download the latest release, then follow [this tutorial](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html#unpacked) that will help walk you through the process.

Localization
------------
Currently the extension is only available in english. New languages can be easily added thanks to the `_locales` folder containing JSON file of all text. If you have translated for a language and would like it added to the extension, either submit a pull request or submit a ticket that has a link to a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/).
